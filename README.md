# AssemblyAI-transcription


This is a web application that transcribes audio files using AssemblyAI's API. It's built with Streamlit.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the necessary Python packages. In your terminal, run:

```

pip install -r requirements.txt

```
3. Run the app with Streamlit. In your terminal, navigate to the directory containing the app file (`main.py`) and run:

```
streamlit run app.py

```
4. Open the app in your web browser. Streamlit will provide a local URL that you can use (usually `http://localhost:8501`).

You will be able to upload your audio file and enter the language code. Then click 'Transcribe' to transcribe the audio. The transcription result will be displayed on the screen.

Note: You need to replace the `'YOUR ID ASSEMBLYAI'` in the headers with your own AssemblyAI API key.
